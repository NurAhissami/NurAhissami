# Â¡Hello! I'm [Nur][website], welcome to my repo! ðŸ˜„


### ðŸ¤” Who I am...
[<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NurAhissami/NurAhissami/main/images/nur-image.png " width="200px">][website]

Front-end developer with three years of experience. I am cheerful, positive, and empathetic, and I feel comfortable working in teams, creating an atmosphere of trust and fostering collaboration. My ability to adapt to changes and my meticulous approach as a designer have allowed me to excel in my work. I enjoy solving problems and facing new challenges with determination and motivation.

In addition to my commitment to professional growth, I am expanding my skills by learning Java to explore backend development.

I actively participate as a mentor in Step4ward, a community of women in Span that helps other women in the sector to start or continue their professional careers.
